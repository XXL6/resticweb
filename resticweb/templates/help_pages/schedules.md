# Schedules list page
A schedule may be paused by clicking the pause button to the right of the "Next Run" column on each row.

When a schedule is paused the Next Run field is cleared.

When a schedule is resumed it will reschedule itself and display the Next Run time. The schedule will nod, however, be counted as "missed" if it is unpaused right after it was supposed to run initially and will instead reschedule to the next available time according to its policy.
